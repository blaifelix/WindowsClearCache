# WindowsClearCache
Simple scripts to clear temp files and browser cache/history

## How To Run

There are a couple of parameters that you can run so that you can specify which functions are used. The parameters are:
`-SysPrep`, `-Debloat` and `-Privacy`.

To run this with parameters, do the following:

1) Download the .zip file on the main page of the GitHub and extract the .zip file to your desired location
2) Once extracted, open [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-5.1) (or [PowerShell ISE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/windows-powershell/ise/introducing-the-windows-powershell-ise?view=powershell-7)) as an Administrator
3) On the prompt, change to the directory where you extracted the files:
   e.g. - `cd c:\temp`
4) Next, to run the script, enter in the following:

e.g. - `.\Windows10SysPrepDebloater.ps1`
